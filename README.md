This research is conducted within the PyTorch framework. Specifically, cnn_tran.py serves as the training code, cnn_test.py is the testing code.
vit_model.py defines the structure and parameters of the ViT (Vision Transformer) model, and vit_test.py is the testing code for the ViT model. 
It should be noted that normalization needs to be determined based on the variance and standard deviation of the free data.
